            <h3><span class="journey-step-number">1</span> Opportunity Discovery: The "Why"</h3>
            <p>I identified a critical gap in the 2026 financial landscape. While the Fed has kept interest rates high, traditional banks still pay 0.01%. Most consumers are "losing money" to a 2.7% inflation rate without realizing it. I set out to build FutureValue—a tool that doesn't just calculate interest, but visualizes the "Cost of Inaction."</p>

            <h3><span class="journey-step-number">2</span> Target Audience: The "Anxious Optimizer"</h3>
            <p>Before building, I defined exactly who this was for. I targeted the "Cautious Saver":</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>The User:</strong> Individuals with $5k–$50k in traditional savings.</li>
                <li><strong>The Problem:</strong> They are risk-averse and find the stock market "scary," so they do nothing.</li>
                <li><strong>The Barrier:</strong> They find traditional financial jargon overwhelming and don't know which banks to trust.</li>
                <li><strong>The Goal:</strong> Show them that moving money to an FDIC-insured HYSA is a "zero-risk" win.</li>
            </ul>
        </article>
        
        <article class="journey-step sub-section">
            <h3><span class="sub-indicator">↳</span> Problem Validation: Hearing It From Real Users</h3>
            <p>Before drafting requirements, I interviewed five "Cautious Savers" to validate key assumptions. They shared confusion about bank terms, fear of risky investments, and uncertainty about where to move their money—insights that directly shaped the UX and messaging.</p>

        <article class="journey-step">
            <h3><span class="journey-step-number">3</span> Strategic Requirement Mapping (The PM Edge)</h3>
            <p>I drafted the product requirements using a "Quality-First" approach from my QA background:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Accuracy:</strong> The math had to be bulletproof. I sourced real-time January 2026 data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics and NerdWallet and asked Claude to doublecheck the data</li>
                <li><strong>Frictionless UX:</strong> I prioritized a "No-Email-Wall" strategy to build immediate trust.</li>
                <li><strong>Actionable Data:</strong> Instead of just showing a percentage, I wanted the tool to show the monthly dollar amount the user is "leaving on the table."</li>
            </ul>

        <article class="journey-step sub-section">
            <h3><span class="sub-indicator">↳</span> Success Criteria: What Does Winning Look Like?</h3>
            <p>I defined early success metrics to align UX goals with business outcomes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Average session duration over 30 seconds</li>
                <li>Bounce rate under 40%</li>
                <li>At least 25% of users reaching the CTA click</li>
            </ul>
            <p style="margin-top: 12px;">These KPIs kept design and copy choices grounded in measurable impact.</p>

            <h3><span class="journey-step-number">4</span> Orchestrating the Build (The Iteration Loop)</h3>
            <p>I utilized Claude (LLM) as my engineering partner, but I acted as the Lead Product Manager to drive several rounds of refinement:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>User Experience:</strong> I pushed to move from a "tile layout" to a Dropdown Bank Selector to reduce cognitive load.</li>
                <li><strong>Branding & Trust:</strong> I corrected the initial "yelling red" color to a muted, professional Coral Red to maintain authority without inducing panic.</li>
                <li><strong>Social Proof:</strong> I directed the creation of a Proven Success Stories carousel, moving away from a space-consuming tile grid to a compact, high-converting layout.</li>
                <li><strong>Content Design:</strong> I identified redundant phrasing and optimized the copy to ensure every word provides unique value, removing repetitive "AI-sounding" text to build user trust.</li>
                <li><strong>Information Architecture:</strong> I mandated a visual separator between the final CTA and the footer and restored the standard navigation hierarchy (Logo left, Tabs right) for a professional, intuitive user flow.</li>
                <li><strong>Technical Quality:</strong> I enforced mobile-first responsiveness and data validation, ensuring all 2026 inflation and interest data was accurate and the layout stayed fluid across all screen sizes.</li>
            </ul>
        </article>
        
        <article class="journey-step">
            <h3><span class="journey-step-number">5</span> Inclusive Product Vision (Accessibility)</h3>
            <p>I didn't treat accessibility as a "bonus feature"; I treated it as a Must-Have requirement. I guided Claude to ensure:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Screen Reader Logic:</strong> Every input (like "Current Savings") is clearly announced for blind users.</li>
                <li><strong>Keyboard Mastery:</strong> The tool is 100% usable via "Tab" and "Enter" keys—no mouse required.</li>
                <li><strong>Visual Clarity:</strong> I enforced high-contrast color ratios (WCAG 2.1 AA) so the data is readable for everyone.</li>
            </ul>
        </article>
        
        <article class="journey-step">
            <h3><span class="journey-step-number">6</span> The Result</h3>
            <p>By managing the AI through these specific strategic lenses, I delivered a production-ready MVP in an hour. The tool successfully translates complex inflation data into a simple, emotional "Aha!" moment for the user.</p>
        </article>
        
        <article class="journey-step sub-section">
            <h3><span class="sub-indicator">↳</span> Learning Loop: What Users Told Us</h3>
            <p>After releasing the MVP, I shared the tool on Reddit's personal finance forums and tracked real usage. Early insights:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>68-second average session time</li>
                <li>31% CTA click-through rate</li>
                <li>Most confusion stemmed from unfamiliar bank names in the selector</li>
            </ul>
            <p style="margin-top: 12px;">Based on this feedback, I planned a V2 feature: HYSA trust scores with side-by-side comparison capability.</p>
